# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.

## Pitch Visualization Feature

### Real-Time Visual Feedback
Display a graphical representation of the user's pitch in real-time. Use a moving line or a color-coded system to show whether they are hitting the target pitch.

### Target Pitch Indicator
Show the target pitch on the same display, allowing users to see how their pitch compares.

### Visual Notes
Display the musical notes on a staff or a piano roll as they are sung.

### Color Coding
Use different colors to represent correct, flat, and sharp notes.

### Spectrogram Display
Provide a spectrogram that shows the frequency spectrum of the user's voice. This can help users visualize the different frequencies they are producing.

### Real-Time Analysis
Ensure the spectrogram updates in real-time for immediate feedback.

### Haptic Feedback
Integrate haptic feedback to complement visual feedback, helping users feel the rhythm and pitch.

### Performance Metrics
Show detailed metrics on performance, including pitch accuracy, note duration, and overall improvement.

### Progress Graphs
Visualize progress over time with graphs and charts.

### Sensitivity Adjustment
Allow users to adjust the sensitivity of pitch detection based on their vocal range and skill level.

### Display Options
Provide options to customize the visual feedback display (e.g., color schemes, types of visual representation).
